They told you it was going to be an easy assignment.  "The Prince will take care of everything," they said.
"He's every experienced," they said.  "Just give him a sword and you'll be home by dinner."
You plan to file a long, detailed report about the accuracy of the prince rating system when you get back,
but right now, you have a more imediate problem.  The prince who you were just supposed to aid in his fight,
took a rock to the head almost as soon as the battle began.  Now you are left to face an invading army of
goblins all by yourself.
At least you thought to take your wand with you, so now you can fire blasts of magic at them.  However, it
does nothing to protect you from the boulders being thrown at you.  You'll just have to hope that all those
wing excercise courses paid off as you dodge the flying rocks.
Yeah, you were definintly submitting a complaint when you got back.
